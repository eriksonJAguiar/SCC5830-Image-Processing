# SCC5830 Image Processing -- Final Project

- **Author:** Erikson Julio de Aguiar (graduate student)
- **proposal objective:** Role of preprocessing techniques to reduce effect of adversarial perturbations on medical images

## Abstract

Adversarial perturbations inserted on medical images may cause misclassifications in machine learning models. As a result, diseases are incorrectly classified forward to poor diagnosis and not assist physicians. Furthermore, malicious agents might generate perturbations and inserted them in images, producing noise to build adversarial features. Our proposal aims to analyze preprocessing methods' role to reduce the impact of adversarial perturbation to break machine learning models. Furthermore, we hope to improve image quality against adversarial perturbations by using methods of image enhancement and restoration.

- Keywords:
  - Main task: Image restoration
  - Application: Medical images with perturbations

## Images examples

- Dataset and images examples

## Next steps

- Choose attack type and perturbation's features
- Apply perturbations to poisoning the images
- Analyze methods of image restoration and enhancement to reduce perturbations
- Partial report (23/06)
- Apply methods comparing to baseline (in our proposal will be without perturbations)
- Evaluate proposal
- Final report (07/07)
