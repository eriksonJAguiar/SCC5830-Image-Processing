# **SCC5830 Image Processing -- Final Project**

- **Author:** Erikson Julio de Aguiar (graduate student)
- **proposal objective:** Analyze the impacts of restoration and enhancement methods to improve images over the rescaling attack


## Abstract

Adversarial attacks insert perturbations on medical images may cause misclassifications in machine learning models. As a result, diseases are incorrectly classified forward to poor diagnosis and not assist physicians. Furthermore, malicious agents might generate perturbations and inserted them in images, producing noise to build adversarial features. One of these is the image scaling attacks aim to produce another image when resize the source image. Our proposal aims to develop a method to detect attacked images and restore them. We will use the difference between histograms to identify the malicious image and restoration methods to recovery affected pixels of the source image. In this project, we hope to improve image quality to protect against image scaling attacks. To evaluate, we will use as a source image a dataset from Kaggle with images of chest X-ray and target image. We will apply non-medical images to fool tools when there is resized.

## Dataset

- Dataset contains 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) with 2 classes (Pneumonia/Normal). Dabaset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

**Input images example:**
<div style="display: inline-block">
    <img src="./images/chest/chest1.jpeg" width="200"/>
    <img src="./images/cat.jpg" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
  </div>
  
  P.s. Input image example can find on ![chest_images](https://github.com/eriksonJAguiar/scc5830_final_project/tree/main/images/chest_images)
  
 **Result image after attack**

 P.s. Attack images examples can find on ![attacks_experiments](https://github.com/eriksonJAguiar/scc5830_final_project/tree/main/images/attacks_experiments) (Nearest-neighbor interpolation), also others crafted images are available on ![attacks](https://github.com/eriksonJAguiar/scc5830_final_project/tree/main/images/attacks)  (different interpolations methods) 
 
  **Restored image after attack**
 
 - Median filter:
